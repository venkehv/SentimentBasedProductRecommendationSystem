# Ebuss Product Recommendation System
Welcome to the Ebuss Product Recommendation System repository! This project showcases a comprehensive approach to building a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform, Ebuss. The system combines collaborative filtering techniques with sentiment analysis to provide personalized product recommendations to users.

## Features
User-Based Recommendation: Utilizes collaborative filtering to recommend products based on user behaviour and preferences.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes user sentiment from product reviews to refine recommendations further.
Flask Web API: Deploys a Flask-based web API to serve real-time recommendations for a given user.
Heroku Deployment: Hosts the web API on Heroku for easy access and sharing.

## Evaluation
The recommendation system is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for user- and item-based collaborative filtering. The sentiment analysis model's performance is validated by analyzing the correlation between predicted sentiments and user ratings.
